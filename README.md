# ProjectTerminal

# This program simulates a Terminal with custom commands.
# Please use a Python 3.5.3 interpreter.
# You can run this program on any interpreter that's Python 3 or new, but results aren't guaranteed if you do.
# The file on this repository is the installer for this program, as it requires 7 other text files in order to work.
# Just run the program and you will be good.
